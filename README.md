In this repository I will be updating all of my practice codes<br>
<br>

<p>R-1.1 Write a short Python function, is multiple(n, m), that takes two<br>
integer values and returns True if n is a multiple of m, that is, n = mi<br>
for some integer i, and False otherwise.<br>
</p>
<br>
<pre><b>R-1.2</b> Write a short Python function, is even(k), that takes an integer value and
returns True if k is even, and False otherwise. However, your function
cannot use the multiplication, modulo, or division operators.
