In this repository I will be updating all of my practice codes<br>

<h2>Practice Questions</h2><br>

<h3>Book: <b>Data Structures and Algorithms in Python</b> by Michael T. Goodrich and others</h3><br>

<p><b>R-1.1</b><br> Write a short Python function, is multiple(n, m), that takes two<br>
integer values and returns True if n is a multiple of m, that is, n = mi<br>
for some integer i, and False otherwise.<br>
</p>

<p><b>R-1.2</b><br> Write a short Python function, is even(k), that takes an<br>
integer value and returns True if k is even, and False otherwise.<br>
However, your function cannot use the multiplication, modulo, or<br>
division operators.<br>
</p>

<p><b>R-1.3</b><br> Write a short Python function, minmax(data), that takes<br>
a sequence of one or more numbers, and returns the smallest and largest<br>
numbers, in the form of a tuple of length two. Do not use the built-in<br>
functions min or max in implementing your solution.<br>
