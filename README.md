<h3>Chapter 1 Exercise:</h3>

<h4>R-1.1</h4>
<p>Write a short Python function, is_multiple(n, m), that takes two integer values and returns True if n is a multiple of m, that is, n = mi for some integer i, and False otherwise.</p>   

<h4>R-1.2</h4>
<p>Write a short Python function, is_even(k), that takes an integer value and returns True if k is even, and False otherwise. However, your function cannot use the multiplication, modulo, or division operators.</p>   

<h4>R-1.3</h4>
<p>Write a short Python function, minmax(data), that takes a sequence of one or more numbers, and returns the smallest and largest numbers, in the form of a tuple of length two. Do not use the built-in functions min or max in implementing your solution.</p>
